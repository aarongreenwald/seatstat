            It's a new year and it's time to figure out where your kids will sit in the classroom.
            No big deal, just assign them each to a table and start teaching. 
            Yeah, right.         
            Tim thinks it's funny to pull Jenny's hair, 
            Oscar and Tanisha don't listen to a thing you say when they're at the same table,
            and Molly and Holly like to fight over whose name sounds better. 
            </p>
            <p>
            So you separate them and get back to teaching. For a short while, anyway. As the year progresses, 
            more problems arise and seating your students becomes increasing complicated. 
            You spend hours moving around post-it notes on a table trying to 
            find a setup that works for everyone and you start to wonder why you became a teacher after all.
            It wasn't so that you can do this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now you don't need to. SeatStat will automagically (that's a real word) figure out where everyone should sit.
            Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Type in the names of your students. (SeatStat is magic, but not magical enough to divine their names.)</li>
            <li>Specify pairs of students that can't sit at the same table as one another. 
                Coming soon: specify pairs of students that should sit together</li>
            <li>Click 'Next' and you're done! SeatStat finds a seating chart that works for your class.</li>        
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            SeatStat will remember what you typed in for next time, so you want have to do it all again if 
            you need to add a new set of problem kids and generate a new seating chart. 
            </p>
